## Everything you need for testing

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **:material-language-python: Plain Python**
  
    ---

    Write test plans in plain Python. No DSL - easy to review, version, and maintain.

    ---


- **:material-clipboard-check-outline: Operator-friendly steps**

    ---

    Inline instructions, images, confirmations, and data entry. Operators see exactly what to do.

    ---

- **:material-toy-brick-outline: Reusable drivers and building blocks**
  
    ---

    Connect instruments through drivers/adapters and reuse steps across products.

    ---

- **:material-factory: Production-ready**
  
    ---

    Runs on PCs and SBCs (e.g., Raspberry Pi), works offline, and fits CI.

    ---

- **:material-tag-outline: Traceability by serial number**
  
    ---

    Store results and measurements in a structured way: serial, run, steps, metrics.

    ---

- **:material-database-outline: Flexible storage**
  
    ---

    Save results in CouchDB or JSON, and optionally push to StandCloud.

    ---

- **:material-chart-line: StandCloud analytics (optional)**

    ---

    Track yield, failures, and reruns with production-ready dashboards and serial-level traceability.

## Trusted by teams shipping hardware

HardPy is used by engineers building production test rigs and end-of-line stations. Pair it with StandCloud to store results by serial number, track yield, and catch failure trends early.
