```

## Frontend

### Overview

The frontend of the project can be developed, debugged, and built using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) or command-line tools.
Below are the steps to run, debug, and build the frontend application.

**node.js** and **yarn** are required to build the frontend.

### 1. Running the frontend for Hardpy debugging

To run the frontend application for debugging purposes, you can use the **Run Frontend** configuration in VSCode or execute commands manually.

#### Using VSCode

1. Open the "Run and Debug" in VSCode.
2. Select the **Run Frontend** configuration.
3. Click the "Run" button (or press `F5`).

This will:

- Launch `yarn`.
- Start the frontend application in development mode with debugging enabled.

#### Manually

Navigate to the frontend directory and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

You can specify your own port by adding it as an environment variable:

```bash
PORT=4000
```

By default, the frontend opens on port 3000 at the address [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

### 2. Debugging the frontend

To debug the frontend application in the Chrome browser, use the **Debug Frontend** configuration in VSCode.

#### Using VSCode

1. Ensure the frontend is running (use the **Run Frontend** configuration or manually start it).
2. Open the "Run and Debug" in VSCode.
3. Select the **Debug Frontend** configuration.
4. Click the "Run" button (or press `F5`).

This will:

- Launch Chrome and attach the debugger to the running frontend application at `http://localhost:3000`.
- Enable source maps for easier debugging.

#### Manually

1. Start the frontend application (as described in the **Run Frontend** section).
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Use Chrome DevTools (`F12`) to debug the application.

### 3. Building the frontend for Hardpy package

To build the frontend and include it in the Hardpy package, you can use the provided scripts or run the commands manually.

Use the `compile_front.sh` script from `scripts` folder
or run the scripts manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m build
```

For frontend rebuilding use the `recompile_front.sh` from `scripts` folder
or run the scripts manually:

```bash
pip uninstall $PRJ -y

rm -rf hardpy/hardpy_panel/frontend/dist
rm -rf hardpy/hardpy_panel/frontend/node_modules
rm -rf *.egg-info
rm -rf dist
rm -rf __pycache__

pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m build
```

### 4. Setting the `DEBUG_FRONTEND` variable

To enable debugging for the frontend application, you must set the `DEBUG_FRONTEND` environment variable.
Without this variable, the frontend will not run in debug mode, and the **Run Frontend** and **Debug Frontend** configurations will not work as expected.

#### Option 1: setting `DEBUG_FRONTEND` in VSCode configuration

You can specify the `DEBUG_FRONTEND` variable directly in the VSCode launch configuration.
Here's an example of how to include it in a test configuration:

```json
{
    "name": "Python: Example Dialog box",
    "type": "debugpy",
    "request": "launch",
    "module": "hardpy.cli.cli",
    "console": "integratedTerminal",
    "env": {
        "DEBUG_FRONTEND": "1"
    },
    "args": [
        "run",
        "examples/dialog_box"
    ]
}
```

This configuration ensures that the frontend runs in debug mode when the test is executed.

#### Option 2: setting `DEBUG_FRONTEND` in `.env` file

Alternatively, you can define the `DEBUG_FRONTEND` variable in a `.env` file located in the root of your project. 

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project (if it doesn't already exist).
2. Add the following line to the `.env` file:

```env
DEBUG_FRONTEND=1
```

3. Ensure your VSCode or runtime environment loads the `.env` file. Many tools and frameworks (e.g., `python-dotenv`) automatically load variables from `.env`.

## Adding Translations

To add or modify translations for the HardPy operator panel:

1. Navigate to the translations directory:
   ```bash
   cd hardpy/hardpy_panel/frontend/public/locales/
   ```

2. Create a new folder for your language using its ISO 639 code (e.g., `en` for English, `ru` for Russian, `fr` for French).

3. Inside the language folder, create a `translation.json` file with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "app": {
       "title": "HardPy Operator Panel",
       "lastLaunch": "Last launch:",
      "duration": "Duration",
      "seconds": "s",
       "soundOn": "Turn on the sound",
       "soundOff": "Turn off the sound",
       "debugOn": "Turn on the debug mode",
       "debugOff": "Turn off the debug mode",
       "connection": "Establishing a connection... üßêüîé",
       "dbError": "Database connection error. üôÖüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö´",
       "noEntries": "No entries in the database üôÖüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüö´",
       "status": {
         "ready": "ready",
         "run": "run",
         "passed": "pass",
         "failed": "fail",
         "stopped": "stopped",
         "unknown": "unknown"
       }
     },
     "button": {
       "start": "Start",
       "stop": "Stop",
       "confirm": "Confirm"
     },
     "error": {
       "dbConnectionTitle": "Database Connection Error",
       "dbConnectionMessage": "Failed to establish connection with the database"
     },
     "operatorDialog": {
       "defaultTitle": "Message",
       "imageAlt": "Operator message image",
       "htmlCodeTitle": "HTML Code",
       "htmlLinkTitle": "HTML Link",
       "enterAnswer": "Enter answer",
       "fieldNotEmpty": "The field must not be empty",
       "notificationTitle": "Notification",
       "notificationDesc": "The window was closed. Tests stopped.",
       "numericInputError": "Please enter a number",
       "radioButtonError": "Please select one option",
       "checkboxError": "Please select at least one option"
     },
     "suiteList": {
       "loadingTests": "Loading tests... ü§î",
       "refreshHint": "Try refreshing the page.",
       "standName": "Stand name",
       "status": "Status",
       "startTime": "Start time",
       "finishTime": "Finish time",
       "alert": "Alert"
     },
     "testSuite": {
       "nameColumn": "Name",
       "dataColumn": "Data",
       "loading": "Loading...",
       "stubName": "Test Suite"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Translate all values while keeping the same JSON structure and keys.

Note: Always use valid ISO 639 language codes for folder names.

## Excluding tests from CI

To exclude specific tests from running in Continuous Integration (CI) environments, you can mark them with the `@pytest.mark.manual` decorator.
These tests will be skipped during automated test runs but can still be executed locally when explicitly selected.

```python
@pytest.mark.manual
def test_of_manual():
    assert True
```

## Launch

1. Install dependencies or create environment.
2. Compile frontend if it's the first launch.
3. Launch `hardpy init` with path to tests folder.
4. Launch **CouchDB** instance.
5. Launch `hardpy run` with path to tests folder.

- HardPy panel: http://localhost:8000/
- CouchDB: http://localhost:5984/_utils/
