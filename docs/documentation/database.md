# Database

## About

We use CouchDB because it's a simple document-oriented NoSQL database.
The database has two main purposes:

- Saving test report;
- [Data synchronization](./../about/frontend_sync.md) with the web interface.

The CouchDB version must be equal to or greater than the 3.2 version.

## Database in pytest-hardpy

### Description of databases

The pytest plugin has 2 databases: **statestore** and **runstore**.

- The **statestore** database uses for frontend [data synchronization](./../about/frontend_sync.md).
- The **runstore** database contains the document **current**, which is a JSON object
that stores the current state of the test run.

A separate database is required to store the list of reports.
The **report** database is used as an example of storing reports on past testing runs.
It can be launched in the same instance as the **statestore**, **runstore** database, or in a different one.
The database is accessed through the **CouchdbLoader** class, which can be called at the end of each launch.
To read the current report, use the `get_current_report()` function.

Sample code for saving a report at the end of testing:

```python
# conftest.py
def save_report_to_couchdb():
    report = get_current_report()
    if report:
        loader = CouchdbLoader(CouchdbConfig())
        loader.load(report)


@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
def fill_actions_after_test(post_run_functions: list):
    post_run_functions.append(save_report_to_couchdb)
    yield
```

**HardPy** users have the flexibility to choose their preferred database.
They can write custom classes to record reports at the end of testing.

### Runstore scheme

The **runstore** and **report** databases have the same schema, as **runstore**
stores the current report and **report** stores reports.

<h1 align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everypinio/hardpy/main/docs/img/database/runstore.png" alt="runstore_scheme">
</h1>

The **current** document of **runstore** database contains some section.

## CouchDB instance

This section explains how to launch and manage a CouchDB instance.
After launching the database, it becomes available at the following address:

> http://localhost:5984/_utils/

The internal settings of the database are contained in the **couchDB.ini** configuration file.
It contains settings that define the behavior and operating parameters of the database.

### Running CouchDB with Docker Compose

An example configuration for running CouchDB via Docker Compose is located in
the `example/database/couchdb` folder.
A shortened version of the instructions is described below.

1. Create a `docker` directory in the project's root directory.
2. Create a `couchdb.ini` file in the `docker` directory.

```ini
[chttpd]
enable_cors=true

[cors]
origins = *
methods = GET, PUT, POST, HEAD, DELETE
credentials = true
headers = accept, authorization, content-type, origin, referer, x-csrf-token
```
3. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file in project's root directory.

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  couchserver:
    image: couchdb:3.4
    ports:
      - "5984:5984"
    environment:
      COUCHDB_USER: dev
      COUCHDB_PASSWORD: dev
    volumes:
      - ./docker/dbdata:/opt/couchdb/data
      - ./docker/couchdb.ini:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.ini
```
4. Run **docker compose** in the root directory.

```bash
docker compose up
```
5. To stop the database, run the command:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Running CouchDB with Docker

1. Create `couchdb.ini` file.

```ini
[chttpd]
enable_cors=true

[cors]
origins = *
methods = GET, PUT, POST, HEAD, DELETE
credentials = true
headers = accept, authorization, content-type, origin, referer, x-csrf-token
```
2. The Docker version must be 24.0.0 or higher. Run the Docker container (from the folder with the couchdb.ini file):

```bash
docker run --rm --name couchdb -p 5984:5984 -e COUCHDB_USER=dev -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=dev -v ./couchdb.ini:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.ini couchdb:3.4
```

Command for Windows:

```bash
docker run --rm --name couchdb -p 5984:5984 -e COUCHDB_USER=dev -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=dev -v .\couchdb.ini:/opt/couchdb/etc/local.ini couchdb:3.4
```

The container will be deleted after use.

### Running CouchDB with binary packages in Linux

1. Use this [instruction](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/unix.html#installation-using-the-apache-couchdb-convenience-binary-packages) to install CouchDB.
2. The installer asks you if you want to install CouchDB as a standalone
application or in a clustered configuration.
Select `Standalone` and press Enter.
3. You are prompted to enter the Erlang Node Name.
You can ask it in Terminal with the command `hostname -f`.
4. Set the Erlang Magic Cookie.
This is a unique identifier, for example, `test1234`.
5. Configure the network interfaces on which CouchDB will be bound
`localhost` is fine.
6. Enter an admin password of your choice for CouchDB, press `Enter`, re-type the password
and press `Enter` again to continue the installation.
7. After launching the database, it becomes available at the following
address http://localhost:5984/_utils/.
Open it.
8. First of all, in the `User Management` section in the `Create Admins` tab,
create a user with the login `dev` and password `dev`.
9. In the `Config` choose `CORS` and appoint `Enable CORS` with `All domains`.

#### To disable the CouchDB service:

Remove packages:
```bash
sudo apt remove --purge couchdb
```
Remove GPG keys and repository:
```bash
sudo rm /usr/share/keyrings/couchdb-archive-keyring.gpg
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/couchdb.list
```
Clean APT cache:
```bash
sudo apt clean
```
